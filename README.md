## Assignment Overview
This assignment involves data engineering, data transformation, machine learning, and classification tasks. The main goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models for classifying network traffic data.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Removed any duplicate rows.
- Handled missing or inconsistent data, if any.
- Transformed categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
- Scaled numerical features for modeling.

### 2. Data Splitting
- Split the dataset into training and testing subsets for model training and evaluation.

### 3. Model Building
- Utilized various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation
- Trained each model using the training data.
- Evaluated model performance on the testing data.
- Calculated accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and balanced score class-wise and overall.

### 5. Inferences
- Reviewed and analyzed the classifier metrics to make inferences about model performance.
- Identified classes with high precision and recall.
- Assessed overall accuracy and model strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion

- The machine learning models were trained and evaluated on network traffic data.
- Class-wise metrics provided insights into individual class performance.
- The overall accuracy of the models was assessed.
- Inferences about model strengths and areas for improvement were made based on the metrics.

This README provides an overview of the steps taken and the inferences drawn from the assignment. The code for data processing, modeling, and evaluation can be found in the associated script or notebook files.
